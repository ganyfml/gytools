In addition to providing worldwide email and telephone support, AMEND runs a patient registry and produces patient information with the help of an expert medical advisory team. Membership of AMEND is free and open to patients and health professionals. AMEND continually strives to look for ways of improving the care and management of MEN patients. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is a rare genetic disorder in which benign (noncancerous) tumors arise from the cells of various glands of the endocrine system, most often the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary glands. These affected glands secrete excessive amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, which can result in a variety of symptoms. Some benign tumors associated with MEN type 1 can become malignant (cancerous). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN type 2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by tissue overgrowth or tumor formation in various endocrine glands including the thyroid, the adrenal glands and the parathyroid. MEN type 2 is further classified into three distinct subtypes, MEN type 2A, MEN type 2B and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). All three subtypes of MEN type 2 carry an increased risk of developing a specific form of thyroid cancer called medullary carcinoma. Individuals with MEN type 2A also have an increased risk of developing benign tumors of the parathyroid (adenomas) and the adrenal glands (pheochromocytomas). MEN type 2A is associated with pheochromocytomas, multiple tumors of nerve tissue (neuromas), and multiple nerve cell tumors (ganglioneuromatosis) in the gastrointestinal tract.

Their number one priority is the compassionate and respectful evaluation of patients who suffer from the numerous symptoms that comprise the Chiari syndrome. The Wisconsin Chiari Center seeks to identify the most likely cause or combination of causes of these symptoms in any given patient, be it the Chiari 1 malformation, cervical stenosis, syringomyelia, tethered spinal cord, or POTS. They seek to develop a treatment plan that offers the greatest benefit to the patient with least possible risk. Their mission is also to learn from their experience so that they may contribute to the education of the medical community regarding these disorders in the hope of eliminating delay in diagnosis and treatment in the future. Arnold-Chiari malformation is a rare malformation of the brain that is sometimes, but not always, apparent at birth. It is characterized by abnormalities in the area where the brain and spinal cord meet that cause part of the cerebellum to protrude through the bottom of the skull (foramen magnum) into the spinal canal. This interferes with the flow of cerebral spinal fluid to and from the brain, leading to accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the empty spaces of the spine and brain. The portion of the cerebellum that protrudes into the spinal canal can become elongated and is called the "cerebellar tonsils" because it resembles the tonsils. It is the compression of the brain stem and spinal cord that is primarily responsible for the symptoms. The Wisconsin Chiari Center has learned that compression that is sufficient to cause symptoms can occur even when the cerebellar tonsils protrude by as little as 1 millimeter.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that is detectable during the first days of life with appropriate blood testing (e.g., during routine neonatal screening). PKU is characterized by absence or deficiency of an enzyme (phenylalanine hydroxylase) that is responsible for processing the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids, the chemical building blocks of proteins, are essential for proper growth and development. With normal enzymatic activity, phenylalanine is converted to another amino acid (tyrosine), which is then utilized by the body. However, when the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme is absent or deficient, phenylalanine abnormally accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.

Chiari I malformation is a congenital malformation in which the back compartment of the skull is formed too small and results in crowding of neurological tissues. The lower part of the cerebellum, called the cerebellar tonsils, hangs down through the opening at the bottom of the skull and causes blockage of spinal fluid to the spinal canal. This crowding and blockage often brings on neurological symptoms including headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and many others. In some people, spinal fluid can build up inside the spinal cord. This can be due to the blockage from a Chiari malformation, spinal trauma, a tumor, or other causes. As the amount of spinal fluid increases, it creates a cavity in the spinal cord called a syrinx. This results in stretching and eventually injury to nerve fibers. The condition is called syringomyelia and can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the arms, legs, and body.

They seek to help affected individuals and their families by marshalling the necessary forces to advance research and clinical studies, and to find a cure. Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various toxic materials in the body's cells as a result of enzyme deficiencies. There are nearly 50 of these disorders altogether, and they may affect different parts of the body, including the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and central nervous system. New lysosomal storage disorders continue to be identified. While clinical trials are in progress on possible treatments for some of these diseases, there is currently no approved treatment for many lysosomal storage diseases. Although the signs and symptoms vary from disease to disease in this group, symptoms occur in each case because of an enzyme deficiency that inhibits the ability of the lysosomes present in each of the body's cells to perform their normal function. The lysosomes function as the primary digestive units within cells. Their function is to break down complex components into simpler ones. Each cell has hundreds of lysosomes that degrade complex cellular components such as proteins (substrates) into simpler components. When this process does not take place, the substrate begins to accumulate in the cells. That is why these diseases are called "storage diseases". The symptoms of lysosomal storage disorders are generally progressive over a period of time.

Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder which causes progressive muscle weakness as a result of the build up of glycogen in the muscle cells. Three separate forms of Pompe disease have been identified. The infantile form is characterized by severe muscle weakness and abnormally diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) without muscle wasting, and usually manifests within the first few months of life. Additional abnormalities may include enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly), the liver (hepatomegaly), and/or the tongue (macroglossia). Progressive cardiac failure usually causes life-threatening complications by the age of 12 to 18 months. The childhood form usually begins during late infancy or early childhood. The extent of organ involvement may vary among affected individuals; however, skeletal muscle weakness is usually present with minimal cardiac involvement. In the adult form of Pompe disease, symptoms include muscle weakness such as that found in other chronic muscle disorders. Onset of symptoms usually occurs in the second to fourth decade. This form of the disorder is slowly progressive without cardiac involvement.

The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation offers a wide array of free services including## national toll-free support, educational programs, homecare, support groups, assistive technology, publications, a comprehensive website, and more to improve the quality of life for those affected by MS. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neuroimmunologic (both the nervous system and the immunological system are involved) disorder of the central nervous system involving the brain, spinal chord and optic nerves. By means of a mechanism not clearly understood, the protective fatty, insulating substance called myelin sheath that covers the nerve is destroyed. The inflammatory attacks that produce the characteristic scarring (plaques or patches) of the myelin sheath occur randomly, vary in intensity, and at multiple sites. The course of the disease may advance, relapse, remit, or stabilize. The randomness of the location of plaques or patches affects the nerve’s ability to transmit information (neurotransmission) and causes a wide range of neurological symptoms, which may vary from person to person.

SMA is a motor neuron disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and respiratory complications. Among genetic diseases, it is a leading cause of death among children under age two. Spinal muscular atrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Molecular genetic testing has revealed that all types of autosomal recessive SMA are caused by mutations in the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene on chromosome 5. Deletion of the NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein) gene that is close to the SMN gene is also associated with SMA. SMA is divided into subtypes based on age of onset of symptoms and maximum function achieved.

name##Bartter Site	Website##http://barttersite.org/	Description##The Bartter Site (BS) is an educational website and resource for those seeking information on Bartter and Gitelman syndromes. Bartter Syndrome Support Group is an international online support group that offers patients a place to discuss symptoms and treatments. Bartter’s syndrome (BS) is a group of conditions involving enlargement of certain kidney cells, blood that is more alkaline than normal, high levels of potassium and chloride in the urine, loss of potassium from the kidneys (renal potassium wasting), dehydration, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, frequent urination, and growth deficiency, potentially resulting in dwarfism. It is thought to be caused by a defect in the body’s ability to reabsorb potassium. Loss of potassium may result from overproduction of a certain hormone (aldosterone) that is essential in controlling blood pressure and regulating sodium and potassium levels (hyperaldosteronism). Low potassium levels may be associated with a disturbance in an affected individual’s acid-base ratio (i.e., an accumulation of base or loss of acid). This is known as hypokalemic alkalosis. Symptoms and their intensity vary among the various types of Bartter’s syndrome. Of the various types of this syndrome, the one known as Gitelman syndrome appears generally to be the mildest and to present later in life, often in adults without symptoms (asymptomatic) who are found to have lack or loss of potassium (hypokalemia) on routine laboratory testing.

Comedienne Gilda Radner died in 1989 after a long, courageous battle against ovarian cancer. Neither she nor her husband, Gene Wilder, knew that her family history of ovarian and breast cancer put her at a high risk for developing ovarian cancer. The registry, which was renamed in her honor, currently has over 1,700 families enrolled. Ovarian cancer refers to a group of diseases that are characterized by uncontrolled growth and division of cells of the ovary. The cells may grow to form a tumor on the ovary and may also break off from the main tumor and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry conducts research into the causes of familial ovarian cancer in collaboration with investigators at Stanford University of Medicine and Cambridge University.

Histocompatibility testing is the performance of specialized analyses (assays) to determine whether the recipient and donor are histocompatible, i.e., that they share antigens so that transplanted tissue is accepted and remains functional. Histocompatibility antigens are proteins on the surface of the cells in the body that help the immune system defend against invaders, such as bacteria and viruses; in addition, the immune system may recognize the histocompatibility antigens of other people's cells as foreign, resulting in rejection of transplanted tissues or organs. The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics also performs an on-site laboratory inspection every two years to ensure that accredited laboratories comply with all the standards. Both the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) utilize the accreditation services of ASHI to inspect and certify that member histocompatibility laboratories comply with the standards.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare malignancy characterized by the progressive accumulation of mucus-secreting (mucinous) tumor cells within the abdomen and pelvis. PMP develops after a small growth (polyp) located within the appendix bursts through the wall of the appendix and spreads mucus-producing tumor cells throughout surrounding surfaces (e.g., the membrane lining the abdominal cavity [peritoneum]). As mucinous tumor cells accumulate, the abdominal area becomes swollen and digestive function becomes impaired. Pseudomyxoma peritonei develops at a variable rate, but may grow at a slower rate (indolent) than other malignancies within the abdomen. PMP Pals assists and serves newly diagnosed patients, and their caregivers, as a source of information and referrals to physicians experienced in the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis and all mucin producing cancers originating from the appendix. Though PMP Pals do not endorse any particular physician or medical facility, their database includes an international listing of surgeons, oncologists and pathologists experienced in treating pseudomyxoma peritonei and related diseases. PMP Pals shares resources and information to assist patients in living well with the challenges of pseudomyxoma peritonei, and they provide assistance to patients and their family caregivers in preparing for, and recuperating from, surgery and/or chemotherapy. They promote networking opportunities by providing to subscribing members the Pal Mentoring Program which links patients, and their family caregivers, with specific Pal Mentors, based on each patient’s diagnosis, gender, surgeon, and special needs. PMP Pals also offer a subscription to monthly PMP Pals newsletters and weekly bulletins, a series of three PMP Pals’ Network Handbooks, participation in more than two dozen specialized Pal Resource Groups, participation in their annual international conference, and use of their extensive website.

Progressive supranuclear palsy is a comparatively rare neurologic disorder (prevalence some 6 per 100,000). It is a progressive brain disease, involving the progressive death of neurons in the mid brain immediately above the nuclei (hence supranuclear), which control balance, movement, vision - particularly upgaze and downgaze - speech and ability to swallow. It is characterized by spastic weakness of muscles affected by the cranial nerves (i.e., muscles of the face, throat, tongue). Symptoms may include falling, difficulty walking (ataxia), vision disturbances, and difficulty in speech (dysarthria) and swallowing.

The Neurofibromatosis Clinic offers a comprehensive initial evaluation to all persons in whom a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis has been suggested or confirmed. In addition to a neurological examination this includes a dermatological evaluation and referral for neuro-ophthalmological evaluation and imaging studies. Many persons come to the clinic with a diagnosis of "rule out neurofibromatosis" and the role of the clinic is to clarify whether or not that diagnosis can be made. Others come because they are a first degree relative of an NF patient and are thus at 50-50 risk for the disease. Because so much is now known about the natural history and genetic risks of these diseases, it is always important to make a clear diagnosis at the onset in any one person.

Their mission is to find the cause(s) of AHC, develop effective treatments and ultimately find a cure, while providing support to the families and children with AHC by funding research to accomplish these goals. Secondarily, they strive to promote proper diagnosis, educate health care professionals, the public and related organizations, encourage the worldwide exchange of information and advance the development of an international database of all AHC patients. AHC is a rare neurological disorder in which repeated, transient attacks of hemiplegia occur, usually affecting one side of the body or the other, or both sides of the body at once. The attacks may last for minutes, hours or even days and are normally relieved by sleep. Typically the onset of symptoms begins prior to 18 months of age. AHC episodes are often associated with triggers that precede or induce the attack. Triggers for AHC episodes may include - but are not limited to - environmental conditions (such as temperature extremes or odors), water exposure, physical activities (exercise, swinging), lights (sunlight, fluorescent bulbs), foods (chocolate, food dye), emotional response (anxiety, stress, fright), odors (foods, fragrances), fatigue, and medications. Recently, the discovery of the mutation in the gene ATP1A3 has been identified as one cause of AHC and is found in two-thirds of those affected while ongoing research is close to identifying the remaining genetic mutations. Once the causes have been identified, AHCF will shift their focus to developing much needed treatment options.

NDRI, with funding from the National Institutes of Health, provides all types of normal and diseased tissues to researchers studying a wide range of common and rare diseases and disorders. It is very helpful for NDRI to receive notification as soon as possible. Medical research involves study of living cells and tissues, which have a limited viability after death. Some fragile tissues, like eyes or heart, need to be recovered within a few hours after death; brain tissue, bone, and other more durable tissues are sometimes viable up to 12-24 hours after death. Therefore, it is important that the designated NDRI contact be notified immediately and it is helpful to finalize these arrangements in advance if possible, since rapid recovery of cells and tissues is very important.

Burton Syringomyelia Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization whose mission is to raise and distribute funds to those who are recently diagnosed with syringomyelia and can demonstrate a financial and medical need; assist with short or long term financial assistance while social services are pending or insufficient; educate the medical community; and raise awareness in the general public in hopes of finding a cure someday soon. Syringomyelia is a neurological disorder characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord. This cyst may, for unknown reasons, expand during adolescence or the young adult years, destroying the center of the spinal cord as it does. As the syrinx expands, it affects the nerves that stimulate the patient’s legs, arms, back and shoulders. In turn, the affected individual may feel considerable pain and weakness, and may lose the ability to distinguish hot from cold objects. The combination of symptoms and signs may vary considerably from person to person, depending on where in the spine the syrinx is located and how much it expands over time. Often, the symptoms develop slowly. Unless the condition is treated surgically, it may lead to neurological deficits and chronic, intense pain. In most cases, syringomyelia is a congenital (present at birth) abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation. The malformation occurs during the development of the fetus, for reasons that aren’t well understood yet. Syringomyelia may also occur as a complication of trauma, spinal cord injury, meningitis, hemorrhage, or a tumor. Symptoms may not appear until years after the initial injury. In rare cases, syringomyelia appears to be familial or genetically transmitted.

name##Fibrosing Mediastinitis Informational Website	Email Address##t.edgell@fibrosing-mediastinitis.com	Website##http://www.fibrosing-mediastinitis.com	Description##The web site www.fibrosing-mediastinitis.com was created to provide support and information to patients and families who are affected by fibrosing mediastinitis (FM). Mediastinal fibrosis is the least common, but the most severe, late complication of histoplasmosis. Many physicians believe mediastinal fibrosis to be an abnormal immunologic response to antigens released by the soil-based fungus histoplasma capsulatum. It should be differentiated from the many other less-severe mediastinal complications of histoplasmosis, and from other causes of mediastinal fibrosis, which are termed idiopathic mediastinal fibrosis. Idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis is even less common, but may have multiple causes, none of which are related to histoplasmosis. Accordingly, there are two types of fibrosing mediastinitis; histoplasmosis-related fibrosing mediastinitis, and idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis which may have multiple causes unrelated to histoplasmosis. Both types are rare disorders caused by proliferations of collagen, fibrosis tissue and associated inflammatory cells within the mediastinum (the space between the lungs). Patients with histoplasmosis-related fibrosing mediastinitis present with signs of fatigue, shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough with (hemoptysis) or without blood, chronic lung (pleuritic) pain and recurrent pulmonary infection. Patients with idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis present symptoms of fever, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, coughing and severe chest pains.
