Charlotte & Gwenyth Gray Foundation to Cure Batten Disease	curebatten@givingback.org	http://www.curebatten.org	Batten disease is a rare genetically inherited disorder which belongs to a group of progressive degenerative neurometabolic disorders, known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). NCLs are characterized by genetic mutations which disrupt cells’ ability to dispose of wastes, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of certain proteins and lipids within the nerve cells of the brain and other tissues of the body, resulting in progressive neurological impairment including developmental regression, seizures, blindness, behavior changes and dementia. There are many forms of NCL. Mutations in at least eight different genes are known to cause Batten disease. The foundation currently focuses on Late Infantile Batten disease caused by mutation(s) in the CLN6 gene. This particular variant is extremely rare and the disease course can differ significantly among cases, making it difficult to predict.	6033 West Century Blvd Suite 350Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Babies born with Schizencephaly may have developmental delays, impairment of language skills and paralysis of one side of the body. DiGeorge Syndrome is also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, wherein a small piece of chromosome 22 is missing. The symptoms are extremely variable, but can include congenital heart disease, immune system deficiency, endocrine abnormalities, and feeding difficulties. Microcephaly is a medical condition in which the circumference of the head is smaller than normal because the brain has not developed properly or has stopped growing. It can be associated with many rare disorders. Lissencephaly is caused by a lack of development of the ridges of the brain, making the surface appear unusually smooth. This disease causes the head to be smaller, and also causes a host of developmental delays, intellectual impairment, and feeding difficulties.	4208 Chateau Rd.Orlando, FL 32808 USA	407-617-4111	NA	NA	NA

ALD Life	info@aldlife.org	http://www.aldlife.org/	ALD Life is a voluntary, non-profit patient support group and registered charity working with patients and families with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) - a rare genetic condition affecting mainly boys aged 4 to 10. Their main goals are to provide support to patients and families affected by the disorder, provide practical information, and support further medical research towards finding better treatment and/or a cure. Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by an abnormality in the ABCD1 gene on the X chromosome. This condition affects the white matter of the nervous system and the adrenal cortex. Some affected individuals have adrenal insufficiency, which means that reduced amounts of certain hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol are produced, leading to abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, sexual development and reproduction. Some of those affected experience serious neurological problems that can affect mental function and lead to disability and reduced life span. This condition has been categorized into six types based on symptoms and age of onset	45 Peckham High StreetLondon,  SE15 5EB United Kingdom	020 7701 2628	NA	NA	NA
Global FKRP Registry	coordinator@fkrp-registry.org	https://www.fkrp-registry.org/	The Global FKRP Registry is the first international collection of data for both patients and professionals involved in the care of individuals with conditions caused by mutations in the fukutin related protein (FKRP) gene. This includes people with the type 2I form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I) and the type 1C form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C) and, in rare instances, the congenital muscular dystrophies muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome. FKRP-related conditions are rare, thus without a patient registry to gather details in one place from all FKRP patients worldwide, finding enough patients for a meaningful trial can take years. The web-based Registry aims to facilitate the identification of potentially eligible patients for future clinical trials of new therapies, accelerate research into new therapies for these conditions, keep patients informed about research results, and provide more detailed knowledge about the prevalence and natural history of FKRP-related conditions.

The NCLs are characterized by abnormal accumulation of certain fatty, granular substances (i.e., pigmented lipids [lipopigments] ceroid and lipofuscin) within nerve cells (neurons) of the brain as well as other tissues of the body that may result in progressive deterioration (atrophy) of certain areas of the brain, neurological impairment, and other characteristic symptoms and physical findings.

Association for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Disorders (AMEND)	jo.grey@amend.org.uk	http://www.amend.org.uk	The Association for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Disorders (AMEND), a non-profit UK registered charity since 2002, is a patient support group run by volunteers for the benefit of everyone affected by the multiple endocrine neoplasia disorders and their associated endocrine growths. In addition to providing worldwide email and telephone support, AMEND runs a patient registry and produces patient information with the help of an expert medical advisory team. Membership of AMEND is free and open to patients and health professionals. AMEND continually strives to look for ways of improving the care and management of MEN patients. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is a rare genetic disorder in which benign (noncancerous) tumors arise from the cells of various glands of the endocrine system, most often the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary glands. These affected glands secrete excessive amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, which can result in a variety of symptoms. Some benign tumors associated with MEN type 1 can become malignant (cancerous). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN type 2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by tissue overgrowth or tumor formation in various endocrine glands including the thyroid, the adrenal glands and the parathyroid. MEN type 2 is further classified into three distinct subtypes, MEN type 2A, MEN type 2B and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). All three subtypes of MEN type 2 carry an increased risk of developing a specific form of thyroid cancer called medullary carcinoma. Individuals with MEN type 2A also have an increased risk of developing benign tumors of the parathyroid (adenomas) and the adrenal glands (pheochromocytomas). MEN type 2A is associated with pheochromocytomas, multiple tumors of nerve tissue (neuromas), and multiple nerve cell tumors (ganglioneuromatosis) in the gastrointestinal tract.

Their number one priority is the compassionate and respectful evaluation of patients who suffer from the numerous symptoms that comprise the Chiari syndrome. The Wisconsin Chiari Center seeks to identify the most likely cause or combination of causes of these symptoms in any given patient, be it the Chiari 1 malformation, cervical stenosis, syringomyelia, tethered spinal cord, or POTS. They seek to develop a treatment plan that offers the greatest benefit to the patient with least possible risk. Their mission is also to learn from their experience so that they may contribute to the education of the medical community regarding these disorders in the hope of eliminating delay in diagnosis and treatment in the future. Arnold-Chiari malformation is a rare malformation of the brain that is sometimes, but not always, apparent at birth. It is characterized by abnormalities in the area where the brain and spinal cord meet that cause part of the cerebellum to protrude through the bottom of the skull (foramen magnum) into the spinal canal. This interferes with the flow of cerebral spinal fluid to and from the brain, leading to accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the empty spaces of the spine and brain. The portion of the cerebellum that protrudes into the spinal canal can become elongated and is called the "cerebellar tonsils" because it resembles the tonsils. It is the compression of the brain stem and spinal cord that is primarily responsible for the symptoms. The Wisconsin Chiari Center has learned that compression that is sufficient to cause symptoms can occur even when the cerebellar tonsils protrude by as little as 1 millimeter.	2311 N.

Chiari I malformation is a congenital malformation in which the back compartment of the skull is formed too small and results in crowding of neurological tissues. The lower part of the cerebellum, called the cerebellar tonsils, hangs down through the opening at the bottom of the skull and causes blockage of spinal fluid to the spinal canal. This crowding and blockage often brings on neurological symptoms including headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and many others. In some people, spinal fluid can build up inside the spinal cord. This can be due to the blockage from a Chiari malformation, spinal trauma, a tumor, or other causes. As the amount of spinal fluid increases, it creates a cavity in the spinal cord called a syrinx. This results in stretching and eventually injury to nerve fibers. The condition is called syringomyelia and can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the arms, legs, and body.	29 Crest LoopMelville, NY 11747 	7189662593	NA	NA	NA

Hide & Seek Foundation for Lysosomal Disease Research	info@hideandseek.org	http://www.hideandseek.org	The Hide & Seek Foundation for Lysosomal Disease Research is a non-profit foundation whose mission is to raise awareness of lysosomal disease. They seek to help affected individuals and their families by marshalling the necessary forces to advance research and clinical studies, and to find a cure. Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various toxic materials in the body's cells as a result of enzyme deficiencies. There are nearly 50 of these disorders altogether, and they may affect different parts of the body, including the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and central nervous system. New lysosomal storage disorders continue to be identified. While clinical trials are in progress on possible treatments for some of these diseases, there is currently no approved treatment for many lysosomal storage diseases. Although the signs and symptoms vary from disease to disease in this group, symptoms occur in each case because of an enzyme deficiency that inhibits the ability of the lysosomes present in each of the body's cells to perform their normal function. The lysosomes function as the primary digestive units within cells. Their function is to break down complex components into simpler ones. Each cell has hundreds of lysosomes that degrade complex cellular components such as proteins (substrates) into simpler components. When this process does not take place, the substrate begins to accumulate in the cells. That is why these diseases are called "storage diseases". The symptoms of lysosomal storage disorders are generally progressive over a period of time.	6475 East Pacific Coast Highway Suite 466Long Beach, CA 90803 	8776211122	8662158850	NA	NA

Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder which causes progressive muscle weakness as a result of the build up of glycogen in the muscle cells. Three separate forms of Pompe disease have been identified. The infantile form is characterized by severe muscle weakness and abnormally diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) without muscle wasting, and usually manifests within the first few months of life. Additional abnormalities may include enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly), the liver (hepatomegaly), and/or the tongue (macroglossia). Progressive cardiac failure usually causes life-threatening complications by the age of 12 to 18 months. The childhood form usually begins during late infancy or early childhood. The extent of organ involvement may vary among affected individuals; however, skeletal muscle weakness is usually present with minimal cardiac involvement. In the adult form of Pompe disease, symptoms include muscle weakness such as that found in other chronic muscle disorders. Onset of symptoms usually occurs in the second to fourth decade. This form of the disorder is slowly progressive without cardiac involvement.	5100 N. Sixth Street #119Fresno, CA 93710 	5592271898	5592271898	NA	NA

Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males. The most common symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome may include abnormally small testes and impaired function of the testes resulting in infertility. Some males with this disorder may have abnormally enlarged breasts (gynecomastia). The development of secondary sexual characteristics may be diminished resulting in a high-pitched voice and the lack of facial and body hair. Major muscles of the arms and legs may remain underdeveloped. Many other variants of Klinefelter syndrome can occur, including chromosome abnormalities such as 46,XY/47,XXY (mosaic), 48,XXXY, and 48,XXYY. KS&A also provides support to individuals with other sex chromosome abnormalities including females wtih triple X syndrome.	P.O. Box 872Pine, CO 80470-0872 	3034009040	3038380753	8889999428	NA

Its main goal is education, awareness, fund raising, and patient unification. APECED is a very rare genetic syndrome involving the autoimmune system. It is a combination of several distinct disorders and is defined as the subnormal functioning of several endocrine glands at the same time (concurrently). The acronym APECED stands for autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APE), candidiasis (C) and ectodermal dysplasia (ED). Autoimmune disease affecting one gland is frequently followed by the impairment of other glands. Beginning in childhood, yeast infections of either the mouth or nails are usually one of the first apparent symptoms of APECED. Low plasma levels of calcium and phosphate (hypoparathyroidism) are often diagnosed before adrenal dystrophy. There may be an inability to adequately absorb nutrients with resulting diarrhea. Anemia, autoimmune thyroid disease, and loss or delay of sexual development may also occur. The combination of ectodermal dysplasia with candidiasis or hypoparathyroidism may also indicate an APECED patient.	18 Rolling Hill DriveMorristown, NJ 07960 	9738869137	9737344936	NA	NA

The ERC is unique in that, unlike similar foundations, they are the only endometriosis organization in the world to offer free access and participation. Endometriosis occurs in women of reproductive age when the ectopic tissue (endometrium) of the uterus, usually shed during the menstrual cycle, is not completely shed. The tissue escapes the uterine cavity and spreads to other parts of the body. When this happens, the endometrial tissue can bleed during the menstrual cycle causing cramping, severe pain, heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding or bleeding from the rectum or bladder. This endometrial tissue can attach itself to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, lymph nodes, intestines, rectum or in rare cases, the lungs.	630 Ibis DriveDelray Beach, FL 33444-1928 	5612747442	5612740931	8002397280	NA

SMA is a motor neuron disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and respiratory complications. Among genetic diseases, it is a leading cause of death among children under age two. Spinal muscular atrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Molecular genetic testing has revealed that all types of autosomal recessive SMA are caused by mutations in the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene on chromosome 5. Deletion of the NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein) gene that is close to the SMN gene is also associated with SMA. SMA is divided into subtypes based on age of onset of symptoms and maximum function achieved.	1112 Montana Avenue, #372Santa Monica, CA 90403 	3102603262	3103937154	NA	NA

Bartter Site	NA	http://barttersite.org/	The Bartter Site (BS) is an educational website and resource for those seeking information on Bartter and Gitelman syndromes. Bartter Syndrome Support Group is an international online support group that offers patients a place to discuss symptoms and treatments. Bartter’s syndrome (BS) is a group of conditions involving enlargement of certain kidney cells, blood that is more alkaline than normal, high levels of potassium and chloride in the urine, loss of potassium from the kidneys (renal potassium wasting), dehydration, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, frequent urination, and growth deficiency, potentially resulting in dwarfism. It is thought to be caused by a defect in the body’s ability to reabsorb potassium. Loss of potassium may result from overproduction of a certain hormone (aldosterone) that is essential in controlling blood pressure and regulating sodium and potassium levels (hyperaldosteronism). Low potassium levels may be associated with a disturbance in an affected individual’s acid-base ratio (i.e., an accumulation of base or loss of acid). This is known as hypokalemic alkalosis. Symptoms and their intensity vary among the various types of Bartter’s syndrome. Of the various types of this syndrome, the one known as Gitelman syndrome appears generally to be the mildest and to present later in life, often in adults without symptoms (asymptomatic) who are found to have lack or loss of potassium (hypokalemia) on routine laboratory testing.

Due to the lack of medications and diagnostic equipment, the patients may not receive early and timely diagnosis, depriving them of their chance of survival, or causing impairments to major organs, which may further lead to serious complications or even death. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are struggling because either they cannot afford life-sustaining medications or such medications are not imported. There is no formal channel to obtain medications and special diets in Taiwan.	6F., No.20, Changchun Rd.Taipei City,  104 Taiwan	225210717	225673560	225673560	NA

After several seconds, the body relaxes and the heart starts beating, but the sufferer loses consciousness and may remain unconscious for an hour or longer. Established in 1993, this organization provides educational materials for patients and health professionals, gathers information to aid research into RAS, and provides support groups and other services for families. It offers information on all types of syncopes including reflex anoxic seizures, for adults and children.	P.O.

The registry, which was renamed in her honor, currently has over 1,700 families enrolled. Ovarian cancer refers to a group of diseases that are characterized by uncontrolled growth and division of cells of the ovary. The cells may grow to form a tumor on the ovary and may also break off from the main tumor and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry conducts research into the causes of familial ovarian cancer in collaboration with investigators at Stanford University of Medicine and Cambridge University. Research goals include identifying new genes associated with familial ovarian cancer and characterizing lifestyle choices that may reduce ovarian cancer risk in women who may be more susceptible to the disease. The ultimate goal of the registry is to acquire information that will lead to better methods of detecting ovarian cancer and prevent the disease in future generations.

International Diabetes Federation	info@idf.org	http://www.idf.org/	The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is a federation dedicated to working with its member associations to enhance the lives of people affected by diabetes mellitus, a condition characterized by impaired carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism due to deficient production or action of insulin. In type I diabetes, little or no insulin is produced, resulting in an abrupt onset of such symptoms as abnormal thirst, excessive urination, extreme fatigue, constant hunger, blurred vision, irritability, and additional symptoms and findings. This condition, which usually becomes apparent during childhood or adolescence, requires administration of insulin. Type II diabetes, is characterized by insufficient production of insulin, causing a gradual onset of fatigue, blurred vision, unusual thirst, frequent urination, and other abnormalities. This condition typically becomes apparent during adulthood and may often be controlled through diet, routine exercise, and oral medications. The International Diabetes Federation was established in 1950 and has evolved into an umbrella organization consisting of 185 national associations in 145 countries.

Histocompatibility refers to the study of factors that determine the acceptance or rejection of transplanted tissues or organs. Histocompatibility testing is the performance of specialized analyses (assays) to determine whether the recipient and donor are histocompatible, i.e., that they share antigens so that transplanted tissue is accepted and remains functional. Histocompatibility antigens are proteins on the surface of the cells in the body that help the immune system defend against invaders, such as bacteria and viruses; in addition, the immune system may recognize the histocompatibility antigens of other people's cells as foreign, resulting in rejection of transplanted tissues or organs. The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics also performs an on-site laboratory inspection every two years to ensure that accredited laboratories comply with all the standards. Both the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) utilize the accreditation services of ASHI to inspect and certify that member histocompatibility laboratories comply with the standards. The Society's additional programs and activities include conducting an Annual Meeting and a series of regional workshops; publishing ASHI newsletters, Council Meeting Reports, and Committee and Projects Updates; and maintaining a web site on the Internet. The Society's web site provides access to ASHI publications, understandable patient information on immunogenetics and histocompatibility, access to the ASHI Directory Online, and linkage to related sites. The Society also offers open discussions about histocompatibility and immunogenetics on the Internet as well as e-mail discussion groups (listservs) about kidney transplantation and bone marrow transplantation.	1120 Route 73Suite 200Mount Laurel, NJ 08054 USA	856-638-0428	856-439-0525	NA	NA

PMP Pals’ Network	info@pmppals.net	http://pmppals.net/	The PMP (pseudomyxoma peritonei) Pals' Network is a non-profit, all volunteer, worldwide resource and referral service for patients, their family caregivers, and healthcare providers affected by rare cancers originating with the appendix, including mucinous adenocarcinoma, peritoneal carcinomatosis, signet ring cell, cancers affecting the peritoneum and the digestive system, mesothelioma, and pseudomyxoma peritonei. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare malignancy characterized by the progressive accumulation of mucus-secreting (mucinous) tumor cells within the abdomen and pelvis. PMP develops after a small growth (polyp) located within the appendix bursts through the wall of the appendix and spreads mucus-producing tumor cells throughout surrounding surfaces (e.g., the membrane lining the abdominal cavity [peritoneum]). As mucinous tumor cells accumulate, the abdominal area becomes swollen and digestive function becomes impaired. Pseudomyxoma peritonei develops at a variable rate, but may grow at a slower rate (indolent) than other malignancies within the abdomen. PMP Pals assists and serves newly diagnosed patients, and their caregivers, as a source of information and referrals to physicians experienced in the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis and all mucin producing cancers originating from the appendix. Though PMP Pals do not endorse any particular physician or medical facility, their database includes an international listing of surgeons, oncologists and pathologists experienced in treating pseudomyxoma peritonei and related diseases.

In all reported cases, ACD has occurred in association with primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), which is characterized by abnormally increased blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs. Affected infants also typically have misalignment of pulmonary veins, poor development of certain capillaries, and/or other findings. In most cases, during the first days of life, affected newborns develop a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis) due to abnormally low levels of circulating oxygen (hypoxia), and experience difficulty breathing. In many cases, life-threatening complications may result within three to four weeks. The condition usually appears to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadic). However, a few familial cases have been reported. The Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Association was established in 1997 by the parents of a child born with ACD. The association is committed to providing mutual support to affected families through networking services; offering information concerning current research; educating the medical community and the general public about alveolar capillary dysplasia; and working with affected families and the medical community to expand the current knowledge of ACD.	c/o Steve Hanson, President5902 Marcie CourtGarland, TX 75044-4958 USA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Goldenhar Family Support Group	lynne@goldenhar.org.uk or info@goldenhar.org.uk	http://www.goldenhar.org.uk	The Goldenhar Family Support Group is a voluntary organization in the United Kingdom dedicated to supporting families of children with Goldenhar syndrome, a rare disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Goldenhar syndrome, a term that is often used synonymously with "Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral (OAV) Spectrum," is characterized by symptoms and physical features that may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. Such abnormalities tend to involve the cheekbones, jaws, mouth, ears, eyes, and/or bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). Although, in most cases, such abnormalities affect one side of the body (unilateral), some affected individuals have such differences on both sides of the body (bilateral), with one side typically more affected than the other (asymmetry). In most cases, Goldenhar Syndrome (OAV Spectrum) appears to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadic). However, in some cases, positive family histories have been present that has suggested autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. In addition, some researchers suggest that the disorder may be caused by the interaction of many genes, possibly in combination with environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance). The Goldenhar Family Support Group was established in 1989 and currently has approximately 40 members. The Group provides networking opportunities, enabling affected families to meet and/or to communicate with one another by phone or mail.

Massachusetts General Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinic	SPlotkin@partners.org	http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/NFclinic/	Founded in 1982 by Dr. Robert Martuza, the Massachusetts General Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinic was one of the first to acknowledge the unique multi-disciplinary problems that the NF patient and family face--and the vital role that a dedicated clinic plays in the research community. The Neurofibromatosis Clinic offers a comprehensive initial evaluation to all persons in whom a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis has been suggested or confirmed. In addition to a neurological examination this includes a dermatological evaluation and referral for neuro-ophthalmological evaluation and imaging studies. Many persons come to the clinic with a diagnosis of "rule out neurofibromatosis" and the role of the clinic is to clarify whether or not that diagnosis can be made. Others come because they are a first degree relative of an NF patient and are thus at 50-50 risk for the disease. Because so much is now known about the natural history and genetic risks of these diseases, it is always important to make a clear diagnosis at the onset in any one person.	15 Parkman St. 8th Floor, Room 835Boston, MA 2114 USA	6177247856	6177248769	NA	NA

Secondarily, they strive to promote proper diagnosis, educate health care professionals, the public and related organizations, encourage the worldwide exchange of information and advance the development of an international database of all AHC patients. AHC is a rare neurological disorder in which repeated, transient attacks of hemiplegia occur, usually affecting one side of the body or the other, or both sides of the body at once. The attacks may last for minutes, hours or even days and are normally relieved by sleep. Typically the onset of symptoms begins prior to 18 months of age. AHC episodes are often associated with triggers that precede or induce the attack. Triggers for AHC episodes may include - but are not limited to - environmental conditions (such as temperature extremes or odors), water exposure, physical activities (exercise, swinging), lights (sunlight, fluorescent bulbs), foods (chocolate, food dye), emotional response (anxiety, stress, fright), odors (foods, fragrances), fatigue, and medications. Recently, the discovery of the mutation in the gene ATP1A3 has been identified as one cause of AHC and is found in two-thirds of those affected while ongoing research is close to identifying the remaining genetic mutations. Once the causes have been identified, AHCF will shift their focus to developing much needed treatment options.	2000 Town CenterSuite 1900Southfield, MI 48075 USA	(313) 663-7772	313-733-8987	NA	NA

Lipodystrophy is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the selective loss of adipose tissue in various places of the body, especially the tissue under the skin. The resulting loss in the hormone leptin causes imbalances in energy use of the metabolism. It also causes adipose tissue to collect around internal organs. Symptoms include insulin resistance, diabetes, and high cholesterol from adipose accumulation around vital organs. Physical appearance can be altered with displaced areas of adipose tissue. This disease can be both inherited or acquired and affect people of all ages. Subtypes include congenital generalized lipodystrophy, (Berardinelli-Seip Syndrome), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence-Seip Syndrome), familial partial lipodystrophy (includes Dunnigans FPLD and Kobberlings FPLD) and acquired partial Lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons Syndrome). https://idconnect.patientcrossroads.org/; Twitter Handle	22 Frances Road,Los Lunas, NM 87031 USA	209-845-7213	NA	NA	NA

Christopher S. Burton Syringomyelia Foundation, Inc.	info@thesmfoundation.org	http://www.thesmfoundation.org	The Christopher S. Burton Syringomyelia Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization whose mission is to raise and distribute funds to those who are recently diagnosed with syringomyelia and can demonstrate a financial and medical need; assist with short or long term financial assistance while social services are pending or insufficient; educate the medical community; and raise awareness in the general public in hopes of finding a cure someday soon. Syringomyelia is a neurological disorder characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord. This cyst may, for unknown reasons, expand during adolescence or the young adult years, destroying the center of the spinal cord as it does. As the syrinx expands, it affects the nerves that stimulate the patient’s legs, arms, back and shoulders. In turn, the affected individual may feel considerable pain and weakness, and may lose the ability to distinguish hot from cold objects. The combination of symptoms and signs may vary considerably from person to person, depending on where in the spine the syrinx is located and how much it expands over time. Often, the symptoms develop slowly. Unless the condition is treated surgically, it may lead to neurological deficits and chronic, intense pain. In most cases, syringomyelia is a congenital (present at birth) abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation. The malformation occurs during the development of the fetus, for reasons that aren’t well understood yet. Syringomyelia may also occur as a complication of trauma, spinal cord injury, meningitis, hemorrhage, or a tumor. Symptoms may not appear until years after the initial injury. In rare cases, syringomyelia appears to be familial or genetically transmitted.	P.O. Box 100335Fort Lauderdale, FL 33310-0335 	9547275137	9546362409	NA	NA

Fibrosing Mediastinitis Informational Website	t.edgell@fibrosing-mediastinitis.com	http://www.fibrosing-mediastinitis.com	The web site www.fibrosing-mediastinitis.com was created to provide support and information to patients and families who are affected by fibrosing mediastinitis (FM). Mediastinal fibrosis is the least common, but the most severe, late complication of histoplasmosis. Many physicians believe mediastinal fibrosis to be an abnormal immunologic response to antigens released by the soil-based fungus histoplasma capsulatum. It should be differentiated from the many other less-severe mediastinal complications of histoplasmosis, and from other causes of mediastinal fibrosis, which are termed idiopathic mediastinal fibrosis. Idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis is even less common, but may have multiple causes, none of which are related to histoplasmosis. Accordingly, there are two types of fibrosing mediastinitis; histoplasmosis-related fibrosing mediastinitis, and idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis which may have multiple causes unrelated to histoplasmosis. Both types are rare disorders caused by proliferations of collagen, fibrosis tissue and associated inflammatory cells within the mediastinum (the space between the lungs). Patients with histoplasmosis-related fibrosing mediastinitis present with signs of fatigue, shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough with (hemoptysis) or without blood, chronic lung (pleuritic) pain and recurrent pulmonary infection. Patients with idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis present symptoms of fever, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, coughing and severe chest pains.	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Crouzon Support Network, A Program of AmeriFace	info@ameriface.org	http://www.crouzon.org	The Crouzon Support Network is a non-profit support organization for individuals and family members affected by Crouzon syndrome or other rare disorders characterized by abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial). Infants with Crouzon syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, may experience premature closure of the fibrous joints between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis) and, in some cases, progressive hydrocephalus, a condition in which inhibition of the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and abnormal widening (dilatation) of certain cavities of the brain (ventricles) may cause accumulation of CSF in the skull and increased pressure on the brain. Affected individuals may also have additional craniofacial abnormalities including widely spaced and/or abnormally prominent eyes (ocular hypertelorism and/or exophthalmos); outward deviation of one of the eyes (divergent strabismus or exotropia); a beak shaped nose; a short upper lip; an abnormally small, underdeveloped upper jaw (hypoplastic maxilla), causing the lower jaw to protrude forward (relative mandibular prognathism); and/or overcrowding of the teeth. Individuals with Crouzon syndrome may also experience visual and/or hearing impairment; vertigo, dizziness, and/or ringing in the ears (Meniere's disease); abnormal sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis); and/or other abnormalities. The Crouzon Support Network was established in 1997 and currently has approximately 70 members. The network is dedicated to providing understandable information on Crouzon syndrome; providing support and patient advocacy services; and offering a variety of networking opportunities to affected families, enabling them to exchange information, resources, and mutual support. In addition, the Crouzon Support Network offers a listing of craniofacial clinics throughout the United States and Canada, and provides additional referrals.	P.O.
